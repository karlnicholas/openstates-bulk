This package contains classes that hold the 
data returned from LoadBulkData calls.
<p>
The user will typically use the bulkdata package which will
create static instances of these data objects with the fields
filled out by the OpenStates site.</p>

<p>So, for example:<br>
<pre>
new LoadBulkData().load(...);
for( Committee committee:  Committees.committees ) {}
</pre>
