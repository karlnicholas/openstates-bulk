<p>This program is a BulkData loader for the <a href="http://openstates.org/downloads/">OpenStates.org bulkdata.</a></p>

<p>The user will typically use the LoadBulkData class in the org.openstates.bulkdata package.</p>

<p>Java version 1.6 at a minimum is required. The json client library org.fasterxml.jackson-databind.jar, version 2.2.3 was used 
and is required. An earlier or later version may be used but hasn't been tested. Also, the org.openstates.openstates-client package is required.</p>

<p>This requires a ResourceBundle named OpenStates. This means a file
named openstates.properties must be found in your class path, such
as your resources directory. This OpenStates client reads a 
key from the resource bundle, which is mandatory.
This in the form of key=value.
The key is:<br/><br/>

bulkdatadir		(Mandatory) Such as c:/tmp/bulkdata<br/>
</p>

<pre>For Example:
bulkdatadir=c:/tmp/bulkdata
</pre>
